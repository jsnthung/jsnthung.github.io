        Hi, I'm Jason, a Computer Science student passionate about building
        intuitive and engaging user experience, ensuring both usability and
        performance. I love software development, paricularly in mobile
        applications. My expertise lie in front-end development with an eye for
        details. And with a solid understanding of back-end allows me to work
        effectively across the full stack when needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond programming, I enjoy cooking, doing puzzles, learning more about
        marine life and animals, and a bit of photography.
